The front end of the tic_tac_toe game is fashioned after the [React Scalable Boilerplate](https://github.com/RyanCCollins/scalable-react-boilerplate). Many thanks to RyanCollins and others at [Udacity Alumni Client](https://github.com/udacityalumni/alumni-client) team for sharing knowledge.

##How to Run
1. `git clone https://github.com/zhangtreefish/tictactoe_client.git`
2. `cd tictactoe_client`; `cd game_client`
3. Setup the right node and npm so that node is version 5.2.0 and npm is version 3.10.7.
   [I use nodist for my Windows machine. `nodist env 5.2.0`, `nodist npm env 3.10.7`]
4. `npm run setup` to install dependencies
5. `npm run start` to start the app in development mode
